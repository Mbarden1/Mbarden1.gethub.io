      My name is Matthew Barden, I am a junior at Eastern Washington University.
       I am studying to earn a bachelorâ€™s degree in Design as well as a minor in Entrepreneurship.
        Along with that I will complete the User Experience Certificate. 
        My end goal is to eventually become a designer that works with a company to create advertisements, logos and clothing.
       Some passions of mine are playing soccer, making designs on the computer as well as spending time with my friends and family.
